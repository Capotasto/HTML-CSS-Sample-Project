        <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
        <p>
          I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else. I wrote this early in the morning, June 20th, 2013; you're probably reading it at a different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on your phone, a tablet
          or a desktop. You and I have been able to connect because I wrote this and you're reading it. That's the web. Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect here, on a simple HTML page. I wrote this in a text editor.
          It's 6 kB. I didn't need a Content Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's not much code on this page at all, just simple markup for paragraphs, hierarchy, and emphasis.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a web designer, or a client who is working with one, I'd like to challenge you to think about words first. Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup, start with words on a page. What do you have to say? If you don't know,
          there's not much use in adding all that other cruft. Just start with one page, with a single focus. Write it and publish it, and then iterate on that. Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me communicate better?
          Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give my audience more understanding? If the answer's "no", don't add it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show something you've made. And if your
          words are good, people will read them.
